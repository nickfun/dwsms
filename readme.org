This project requires Java 7, Maven, and a Twilio account. [[https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio][Twilio accounts are free to start]].

1. Clone this repo: =git clone http://github.com/nickfun/dwsms.git=
2. use maven to build the project: =mvn package=
3. rename the =example-config.json= to =config.json= and edit it to contain your Twilio dev tokens
   1. note that config.json is in the .gitignore, when you put your tokens in there make sure you continue to keep them secret.
4. run the jar in /target it contains everything you need: =java -jar target/server.jar server config.json=
5. By defaul it serves on port 8080, so view it at [[http://localhost:8080/]]
